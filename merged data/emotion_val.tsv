We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities .  Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives .  We could have another on the successes of graduates from here .  I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that .  That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university .  I ’ m looking forward to reading that .

No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .  It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .  My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .  You said she used to ? How did you stop her ?  We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful .  That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . 	['no emotion']

It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 .  I've heard about that , but I've never tried it .  You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network .  I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers .  That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to .  I just want a private conversation with one other person .  You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them .  Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk .  That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line .  It ’ s that popular ?

DD_9367	9367	Your definition on success ?  Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others .  What ’ s your ideal job ?  Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting .  How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ?  Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best .  How would your present boss describe you ?  He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience .  What would your colleagues say about you ?  They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague . 	['no emotion']

There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other .  You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength .

I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy .  You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .  The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food .  The Taj it is then .  Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ?  They'll still charge us a corkage fee .  That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway .

American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances .  No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants .  You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise .  Why don ’ t you try then ?

It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory .  When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ?  Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time .  There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ?  I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground .  There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ?  I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell .  You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait .  If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . 	['no emotion']

Gambling broke up a happy family .  Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man .

I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ?  I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting .  Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ?  That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic .  I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting .  And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend .  Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer .
