To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ?  I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up .  To be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import .

I still can go out and buy a beer .  Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .  Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen .  I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can .  Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ?  I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself .  Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ?  No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .  So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?  How many students are in the class ?  About fourteen .  So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry .  Damn ! 	['anger']

DD_5605	5605	Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .  I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .  What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?  Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .  Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?  There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .  Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .  I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .  What are your strengths and weaknesses ?  My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .  Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .  I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .  When do you find a job satisfying ?  My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .  How would your coworkers describe you ?  First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .  Do you have any questions ?  Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? 	['no emotion']
