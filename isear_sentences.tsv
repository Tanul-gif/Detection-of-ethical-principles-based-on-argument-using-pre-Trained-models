ISEAR_1054	1054	"My life-partner is going through a crisis (way of life, old-fashioned values)  
and can only get out of it by talking bold decisions.  I have  
noticed his cowardice and attempts to escape his problems by  
drinking.  I detest his drinking and his being full of self-pity."
ISEAR_1055	1055	"Again, a quarrel had come up in our difficult relationship.  My  
life-partner threw all the books off the shelf.  I am sure that it

heart content."

myself.  My hands shook, I flushed and became tongue-tied."
ISEAR_1199	1199	"I felt guilty when I spent a night at my boyfriend's place,

or hurt, my protectiveness was aroused and I got angry."

the day care centre.  Nevertheless, the very day I came back they  
called me early morining to ask me ""what are you going to do  
about the matter ?"" (which had been discussed in the meeting).   
Then I got angry."
ISEAR_1223	1223	"The fact that my mother is getting married again (my mother and  
father divorced about 15 years ago) means that she will probably  
move to Turku, and our home, which is a one family house, will be  
sold (I myself have not been living at home for the past six  
years)."
ISEAR_1224	1224	"While travelling in a bus, there were three people sitting behind

pushed him but not as hard as I had wanted to. We were alone the  
two of us."
ISEAR_1230	1230	"I was on a class excursion, by boat to Stockholm.  At night my  
class mates prepared to clebrate their motive in life which was  
""life is merriment"".  I felt depressed about the way they sought  
happiness."

me a three day furlough."
ISEAR_1249	1249	"When I was 8 years old, I would usually come home from school

how I would get back home."
ISEAR_1250	1250	"I read in the newspaper that the Student Lodging Fund was going  
to build new appartments for refugees (in my opinion this is the  
state's affair).  This is when only a fractoin of the students  
can find an appartment."

two examinations. As I had not studied very much, I resigned  
myself to be left behind. Nevertheless I succeeded in these

much."

saw figures with terrible faces and black frocks bending over me  
and touching me. I opened my eyes but I could still see them. I  
had the feeling that somebody was in the room. It was terrible.  
Only when I turned on the light I was able to go to sleep."
ISEAR_1582	1582	"I had arranged with a friend to go with him to Carinthia by car.

started to cry because I was so angry - it was very important for  
me to go to Carinthia."

attendant. She was very dirty. She started to eat something out

them. I had to leave - I felt like vomitting. "
ISEAR_1585	1585	"I had to go to the doctor's because of a veneral disease. I told

weeks and I had to stay in Turkey for some more weeks because I  
had a job there."

when we had the dissecting-course. I cannot understand why some  
persons like this course."
ISEAR_1598	1598	"Some time ago we had a tournament in our tennis-club. For  
tactical reasons I was chosen to play against a much weaker  
player than I am. Although it would have been enough simply to  
win the game, I defeated him extremely. This would not have been  
necessary."
ISEAR_1599	1599	"I had a discussion with my girl-friend. After some time we  
started to quarrel and at least - to get the upper hand - I said  
that she was not as important to me as she might believe. Some  
time later I apologized for that."

I was prevented from eating."

At that moment I did not care much but now the impression fills  
me with disgust."

others I let my friend sit alone, although I had asked her to  
come."
ISEAR_1606	1606	"I called my little sister to make her pick up her toy from the

fourth time, we began to quarrel. At last the whole family was  
involved in this quarrel and trouble was brewing."

to join the conversation."
ISEAR_1613	1613	"I was on a concert-tour and therefor seperated from my  
boy-friend. But I needed warmth which was given by a male member  
of the orchestra. My feelings towards him were not very deep, but  
his feelings were. I felt guilty when he said ""I am not a  
radiator"".

"
ISEAR_1614	1614	"On my 18th birthday I passed the driving-test. I was glad because

because - as a proof that it was really difficult - not everybody  
had passed the test."
ISEAR_1615	1615	"At about midnight I had to go by bike through Graz alone. On the  
whole it was a distance of several kilometers. A car followed me  
through the streets. Only when I went into a one-way street the  
car disappeared. The rest of my way home I was very afraid."
ISEAR_1616	1616	"I had studied for almost one week for my physics-examination.

her very sympathetic, we had seperated without changing our  
adresses."

time. When I saw the film I was alone and afterwards I hardly  
dared to go to bed and hardly was able to sleep."
ISEAR_1623	1623	"I had got a bad cold. My father said I must be crazy to go by  
motorbike at those temperatures. When I answered him that I did  
not care about a cold, he said that if I did not care for  
anything I could leave him (it was for the second time he said  
something like that)."
ISEAR_1624	1624	"I was at home alone when I realized that a young roe approached  
our house. I hid because I did not want to frighten it. It  
limped. Some time later, when I thought that it had already run  
away, I saw it lying on our terrace. I came nearer and saw that  
it was terribly wounded. I informed the ranger who said that the  
roe must have been attacked by dogs. He had to shoot it."
ISEAR_1625	1625	"Several years ago I stayed with friends in the mountains for one

terrible - nevertheless we all ate rather much and had an  
improper and unsavoury conversation."
ISEAR_1626	1626	"My mother and my grandmother were talking about one of my

died recently."

family. After skiing we went to a restaurant for lunch. Suddenly  
my father said that he had forgotten something in the car. He  
gave me the key and asked me to go and get it. I had difficulties  
with the key which was already bent. I asked my mother to help  
me. When she tried to turn the key it broke. We had no second  
key. My mother was blamed for all that and I did not say a word."
ISEAR_1628	1628	"I had not studied very much for my final examination at school,

examination was not very hard for me - the more I was glad when I  
heard that I had passed it."

very afraid so that I will never forget it."
ISEAR_1630	1630	"My parents are divorced, father pays alimony for me. Two years

her too small, she brought an action against mother. I was  
terribly angry with my sister."
ISEAR_1631	1631	"I arranged with a friend to go skating the next day. He asked me  
to wake him up by telephone at twelve o'clock because we had come  
home late in the morning. Next day I called him - he was not at  
home. As something like that had happened to me several times  
before, I came to the conclusion that one cannot rely on anybody  
and I felt very sad."
ISEAR_1632	1632	Whenever I see a spider or a snake I feel disgusted.

me napping."
ISEAR_1634	1634	"I had been together with my boy-friend for two and a half years,

bit guilty for what had happened."

ran out - I do not know the reason for that. My father came after  
me and insisted on my apologizing."
ISEAR_1641	1641	"I quarreled with my boy-friend. He said it was unfair that I  
always started crying so that he had to give in."
ISEAR_1642	1642	"To be able to prepare myself better for an important examination,  
I did not spend the nitht with my girl-friend but in the  
students' hostel. I had not done that for months. The day when I  
had the examn, somebody knocked at my door at seven o'clock in  
the morning. My girl-friend who likes sleeping late, had come to  
be able to be with me."
ISEAR_1643	1643	"I studied medicine for several semesters and at that time I  
developed a great fear of examinations. I was most afraid of my  
examination of anatomy. While other students were examined, I was  
dissecting. I was able to hear everything and was waiting with  
fear until it was my turn."
ISEAR_1644	1644	"When I come home in the evening, the first thing I do is to sit  
down and smoke a cigarette. One day I found the flat in a totally  
desolate state. My girl-friend had wanted to tidy up but had not  
finished."
ISEAR_1645	1645	"My son's mother told me that she wanted to move to Vienna and  
take the child with her. This means a rather long distance for

I was afraid for her and for the baby."
ISEAR_2689	2689	"I get angry when someone imputes on me things I never can do,  
naturally negative. Servility, ""connections"", impudence, traits  
that get me mad."

ISEAR_2694	2694	"After the term exams I happened to meet a person that I respect

each other rarely he had not forgotten me."

might lose him."
ISEAR_2696	2696	"I have a friend that I deeply trusted but it happened that I lost  
my confidence in her for which she herself was to blame."
ISEAR_2697	2697	"We are several friends but our characters are very different and  
we inevitably split in the two extremes. It is sad that I myself  
don't know what to do, I try not to hurt either of the ""parties""  
because there are conflicts to which one I should belong."
ISEAR_2698	2698	"I stayed for several weeks with a friend of mine before she moved

awful scene, which I still remember."

to be taken to kindergarten, but me the fool didn't dare to tell  
exactly where, finally as a result I was late."
ISEAR_2700	2700	"My roommate got married and invited me to share a flat with them.  
But with a young couple there should not be a third person. I am  
to blame for not following the advise of the others, but it is  
not late still."
ISEAR_2701	2701	"I experienced this feeling when I was accepted as a student.  
Because everything turned out different from my expectations.  
Although I passed the exam successfully I was accepted as a  
student only when I didn't expect it at all, namely at the  
beginning of September."
ISEAR_2702	2702	"In the real sense of the word I experienced fear in my first  
months in the army. During my first night of duty. The cause for  
all this was a bear. I became panic sticken (may be for the first  
time) and even forgot that I had a gun."
ISEAR_2703	2703	"When I was a soldier I quarrelled with my commander and may be in  
revenge for this he detailed me on duty two successive nights.

asleep for which he sent me to the cells."
ISEAR_2704	2704	"Sometimes I experience sadness for the Sports High School and for  
my unrealized dreams in the sport. Anyway there I spent six years  
of my life."

friend to some members of my family, and my niece Yavanna who's  
six was home from school and at Mum's and Dad's and was really  
silly and at first it was ok, but it went on and on - yukky pooh!  
You eat your snot, etc. and I felt cross she wouldn't stop. But  
she had an audience and was in one of those moods. Once I'd  
accepted it was something everyone does at time I felt better -  
it was partly having my friend there."
ISEAR_2706	2706	"In my 20s - and was going out to dinner to celebrate a friend's  
birthday. Her (older - in 30s) cousin, really wanted me to get  
drunk cos I'd visited their (cousin & wife) place quite a bit,  
but had always been very careful - brought up to believe in  
moderation in drink (but not guilt repression etc). I mixed  
drinking with smoking (which I rarely did) and got drunk and had  
to leave the table to get sick in the loo, and later went home  
and was sick again; have never felt so awful in my life. And I  
didn't want to face or tell my other flatmates, or family."
ISEAR_2707	2707	"I used to pinch change from my father's mantlepiece (never my  
mother - she didn't get enough housekeeping) and then I'd feel  
when we went to church as a family I'd felt awkward cos I felt  
I'm expected to go to communion and I would but I was afraid and  
guilty 'cos I committed a mortal sin."

falsely trying to impress with my family."
ISEAR_2714	2714	"Reported neighbour to police for taking to my daughter with  
baseball ball - her counsellor rang me and after long talk  
convinced me the woman was o.k. I felt guilty for ringing the  
police then guilty for feeling guilty about it."
ISEAR_2715	2715	"Meeting with two of my friends I had not seen for 15 years. They  
were special people to me."
ISEAR_2716	2716	"I was in the Korean War. We were attacked with mortars, me and  
companion. We stopped the jeep and ran for cover. Fortunately  
neither of us was hit but we both came close to being killed."
ISEAR_2717	2717	"I've a situation of responsibility an employee who had a habit of  
being late, came late again after promising to say he would be at  
work in a few minutes, then arrived 3 hours later. He had been  
drinking."

was very sad."
ISEAR_2719	2719	Disgust at myself when I stroked a sleeping girl's private parts.
ISEAR_2720	2720	"My son was apprehended for shoplifting at the age of 14. Because  
I too had been apprehended at the same age I felt the shame of  
not having been able to prevent my son from acting in the same  
way."

in a position of trust."

out in 20 years."

woman with two snarling dogs, demanding we get off the property -  
via a flooded river !"

alsatians and farm dogs with my escape route blocked by a shut  
fence."
ISEAR_2731	2731	"In the house where I live there is a new flatmate. His friends  
unfortunately are the dirt of society, intelligent, fashonable,  
rich and bored. At a party recently they were doing things I  
didn't like done in my house. I felt angry at them."
ISEAR_2732	2732	"I was driving near my girlfriend's house and I decided to keep  
going because it was late and I would be back in the next few  
days anyway. The next day she was killed in a road accident."
ISEAR_2733	2733	"My girlfriend came home after a business dinner at the most  
expensive place in town drunk as a skunk. Whats more she drove  
home and couldn't remember doing so. I was disgusted by her state  
and her actions."
ISEAR_2734	2734	"A good friend of mine told me in comfidence that once he had

thought of which had oppressed me, were not on the date I had  
thought."
ISEAR_2737	2737	When confronted and in my opinion hassled by the police.
ISEAR_2738	2738	"Disgust - no. Maybe it is more precise to say revultion at a worm  
or a snake. But I mean it in a social aspect when somebody had  
behaved like a scoundrel to you, when by his actions he has made  
you change your attitude towards him but I thing this feeling the  
way I meant it, is not typical for the people interrelations."

ISEAR_2777	2777	"I felt a physical fear, if I can call it this way, today, in the bus where  
I was sitting on the first seat. While turning the driver didn't  
see the tram which was making a dash towards us (coming from the  
side I was), and whose driver intended to cross in yellow  
light."
ISEAR_2778	2778	"At an unjust, or to be more precise, at a bureaucratic treatment  
of one's personality."

yours and you are at the bottom of it."
ISEAR_2783	2783	"I sensed such a feeling when I understood I was admitted to the  
University. I was at home, the atmosphere was still, though I  
myself was full of suspense. I tried to do different things. When  
the telephone rang and...! Yes, of course there were other  
situations when I felt a similar feeling but I was unmindful of  
them."
ISEAR_2784	2784	"This feeling I sensed quite recently. It was arisen by the  
terrific thought that I might lose the man I loved !"
ISEAR_2785	2785	"Anger I felt when my boyfriend told me he didn't mind breaking it  
off with me, i.e. each of us to take his own road. Because until  
that moment, he deliberately restricted our dates. The motives  
were brought to my knowledge later."
ISEAR_2786	2786	"Sometimes, when I'm alone I am seized by this feeling. But it  
always helps me to come round and at the same time to judge if it  
is worth. Very often this feeling is caused to me by people -  
friends who I love and respect."
ISEAR_2787	2787	"Such a feeling springs up in me sometimes when I have meals at a  
catering establishment. It is a result either of the look of the  
food or when watching the way some people eat."
ISEAR_2788	2788	This happens to me when I am not prepared in a given subject.
ISEAR_2789	2789	"Quite unconsciously I offended a girlfriend of mine. It was  
really worthy to pass this fact over in silence, but I acted so,  
because I believed I was right. In fact it often happens to me to  
feel guilt, after I have already done the deed."
ISEAR_2790	2790	When I was admitted to the University.
ISEAR_2791	2791	"I had to have my tonsils out. I had been making up my mind almost

hospital room, while I was waiting to be called for the operation I  
felt a real fear - of the pain, of what they were going to do to  
me, of the unknown."
ISEAR_2792	2792	"In a conversation my boyfriend expressed definite and quite  
pretentious opinions and he took up an attitude towards a theory  
which he himself had never known. His information was from  
fortuitous sources."
ISEAR_2793	2793	"Summer, heavy rain, storm - I was standing with my face stick to

ISEAR_2804	2804	"A quarrel was followed by the decision of leaving a person close  
to me. Several days later my regret was great. I was beside  
myself. Quite unexpectedly he came and the conflict was calmly  
solved. I was glad at the possibility to be with him."
ISEAR_2805	2805	"One evening I was watching the news on TV. Again they were  
talking about the danger of war. Suddenly I imagined what it  
might mean for me, for my friends, for the people close to me. I  
felt it a very near and possible event."
ISEAR_2806	2806	"Unfair and unjust attitude toward a person close to me, what I

a deep grief at the end of my eleventh form."

elementary human norms."
ISEAR_2809	2809	"I had not punched a ticket in the bus because I had a card. But  
when the ticket-collector came it turned out that I had forgotten  
it. The shame I felt was great though it was not done on purpose."
ISEAR_2810	2810	"At a moment of affect I offended a person very close to me. He  
had given me ground for that but it was a trifling in comparison

guilt."

I remember about it quite often."

graduate. The way one of my fellow-students behaved made me feel  
disgusted."

because he did not rate me objectively and I failed."
ISEAR_3031	3031	"I met a girl some time ago and I cared very much about her but it  
happened so that we left each other. I felt some sort of sadness, I think  
I can call it so."

but he behaved badly with a girl who used to trust us completely."

and done on the night before."

was quite shameful."

them."
ISEAR_3041	3041	"I felt guilty when I had taken the car keys and I had an accident  
but as my parents did not know who was to blame, they punished my  
brother because I had no driving licence and they thought it  
impossible that had driven the car."
ISEAR_3042	3042	"I felt joy when I was admitted to the Higher Agricultural  
Institute."
ISEAR_3043	3043	"I feel fear quite often but this feeling was very strong last  
year when my husband was quite unexpectedly sent to the hospital."

marks."

told us my father was badly injured in an accident."

in an abominable way."

materials out she turned round and saw me."
ISEAR_3076	3076	"When at times unconscienciously I speak to my mother in a high  
tome but after that I am sorry and I feel guilty."
ISEAR_3077	3077	"Being invited out by a person I wished to get closer to. He  
telephoned and invited me to go out with him the next night."
ISEAR_3078	3078	Watching a horror movie with friends.
ISEAR_3079	3079	"The breakup of a relationship. After the event I was upset/sad  
then angry maybe 2/3 weeks later."

as her family etc."

people similarly - including lying, hiding facts, being  
deceitful, unfair, etc."
ISEAR_3082	3082	"Losing my temper and allowing myself to act childishly by yelling  
and screaming at a person who I felt had done me wrong - in  
effect lowering myself to their level."

after her death I felt very guilty and wished I had done more."

close to my best friend looking straight into the eyes."
ISEAR_3092	3092	"I had to tell someone that I was interested in remaining celibate  
and alone. And that my spiritual master strictly prohibited  
sexual relations outside of marriage. This caused great fear  
through lack of conviction afraid to hurt someone's feelings  
despite my own being hurt in the process."
ISEAR_3093	3093	"In a sociology class I felt very angry towards some members of  
society for exploiting the Polynesian people, dawn raids by  
Police (Martin Luther King, Blacks in S.A.). But this was just a  
reflection of my own shortcomings."
ISEAR_3094	3094	"Felt sad about some street kids in QUEII square, Aotea square.

went into the role of a performing clown."
ISEAR_3095	3095	"I was disgusted by my paranoid attitude towards myself, my  
homework at university and disgusted about my lack of retention.  
Especially in learning another language."
ISEAR_3096	3096	"I felt shame at the hurt I caused to my family especially my  
parent father, shame of hurting people emotionally. A misconceived  
self-blaming that didn't do me any good. Shame at being myself as  
I am."
ISEAR_3097	3097	"I felt guilty at being part of the successful people. Felt guilty  
at being a student when other people were not. Guilt about being  
a potential success in various areas of society. (So stupid this  
emotion)"
ISEAR_3098	3098	"When I meet old past pupils of mine - and find they are all doing  
well - I feel joy. Yesterday I met a young woman (20 yrs) I'd  
taught her at 6 yrs, then at 12 yrs and hadn't seen her for last  
3-4 yrs; she was no longer a waitress but a meter maid for  
Council."
ISEAR_3099	3099	"A Maori language oral test, yeaterday - Although I had studied  
intensely - once in the examiners room ""I blew it"" -  I was so  
nervous I couldn't reply easily - It was very important, but I  
got only blankness."
ISEAR_3100	3100	"A friend visited and made comments that my house/garden were not  
as neat/tidy as in the past. I'd not seen her a year - She  
implied I'd gone to the pack (I'd only been working full time,  
and taking 3 University exams part time)."
ISEAR_3101	3101	"When my father a 4th/5th generation colonial (from Eng.) attacked  
me verbally about my chosen partner. A man whom he discarded  
because his colour skin was not white. His ultimate disgust  
saddned me."
ISEAR_3102	3102	"People who came to our home - and requested ""Put out your smoke"".  
That we should not smoke in our house... and asked not even  
politely. It disgusted me because I think people need to adapt to  
the situation."
ISEAR_3103	3103	"Put down by my father - at a family outing at mutual family  
friends dinner. Told ""Not to Speak"". The attitude by him was  
negative/I was in mid 20s, I had done many things - a wide range  
of experiences. Probably greater than he."
ISEAR_3104	3104	"Not attending school, when  am not sick - but in need of mental  
rest. Staff on your return query your ""sickness"" - it is easier  
in N.Z. to be sick, rather than confide other personal reasons  
etc."
ISEAR_3105	3105	My 3 children - each top his class in the final exams 1984.
ISEAR_3106	3106	"A truck (big one) nearly mowed me off the road (I was driving a  
small Lazer)."

last year."

ISEAR_3114	3114	"When my husband got picked up in our new car for drunken driving.  
We had made a pact the other would not drink and so therefore  
would be the driver for the evening etc. I was not present at the  
time."

family occasion that I should not have missed."
ISEAR_3119	3119	"Being reunited with my family after not having seen them for 5  
years, at the airport. Sheer elation at getting through the  
""paper work"" collecting bags and the anticipation of coming  
through the customs gate."
ISEAR_3120	3120	"I caught a huge eel on a fishing line which I had pulled into the  
boat. I cut the line and threw the whole lot back into the water.  
Later that day and about ten miles away I went swimming and  
someone made the comment wondering how far eels could swim, I  
abruptly ended swimming for fear at an unseen eel for a few days  
until we had left the district."
ISEAR_3121	3121	"My partner without discussing with me the situation decided it  
was time for us to have a break and went ahead and arranged his  
own life for the next 6-12 months, then told me the day before it  
was about to happen having been tolerant and friendly for the  
preceding week."
ISEAR_3122	3122	"I had been living in an overseas city and made the decision to  
leave the city and come home about 12 months before I met a whole  
new set of friends, leaving them at the airport was sad and  
traumatic as they had helped me in many ways and I knew I  
wouldn't see many of them again."
ISEAR_3123	3123	"After I had managed to fail my first year at University I was  
scared as to what I was going to do with my future. I didn't want  
a mundane 9-5 job and yet I didn't know if I could pay my way  
through an unsubsidized year at university to settle down and  
continue my studies."
ISEAR_3124	3124	"This situation keeps occurring - when my little sister disagrees  
with me or vice-versa. We have very similar temperaments and I  
always end up feeling angry at her and myself for fighting so  
much over unimportant trivial matters."
ISEAR_3125	3125	"When my grandmother, who has been living with us for 14 years,  
had a stroke and was left paralysed on one side. She has been  
quite close to our family and to see her suffer in this way makes  
me feel really sad."
ISEAR_3126	3126	"A gathering of a social sports club at which they proceeded to  
show pornographic videos and then afterwards (when most people  
had had quite a bit to drink) carried on in a very degrading,  
unmoral manner - especially females exposing and flaunting  
themselves with no shame or embarassment."
ISEAR_3127	3127	"Like guilt - the most ashamed I have ever felt was when I began  
to feel guilty about having sex with my boyfriend when it was  
only ""the thing to do"", and not really an act of love."
ISEAR_3128	3128	"This feeling of guilt really applies to moral/religious views. I  
(being Catholic) went against what I was brought up to believe in  
and had a sexual relationship with my boyfriend. Many months  
later, when I was doing some deeper self analysis I began to feel  
guilty and realized that I had gone against what I wanted for  
myself and my future."
ISEAR_3129	3129	"My mother along with some of my friends gave me a surprise  
birthday party - they invited a large number of my friends along  
too."
ISEAR_3130	3130	"My mother did not come home till late at night (Ages ago). Anyway  
if I don't know where my parents are and when they'll be back I  
start thinking that perhaps they have had an accident and are  
perhaps dead."
ISEAR_3131	3131	"Because I am the Captain of a basketball team I usually organise  
a roster system so that everyone in the team can have a turn at  
doing either a duty or a ref. A lot of the time the girls can't  
be bothered or just forget - I usually have to fill in."
ISEAR_3132	3132	"So as to be closer to the university I have left home and moved  
into Auckland. It now seems as if I have left home - especially  
my family - forever."
ISEAR_3133	3133	"A friend of mine goes out with this guy. She sleeps with him but  
is quite happy for him to play around - as well as herself."
ISEAR_3134	3134	NO RESPONSE.
ISEAR_3135	3135	"I did not attend a social studies observation class for 1 whole  
week (I am a student trainee teacher). Anyway the other teachers  
thought this was okay because the teacher I was supposed to  
observe was not well liked. The teacher was in fact really nice  
to me - but I wanted to get out of teaching a hard topic he had  
given me."
ISEAR_3136	3136	"Passing my pharmacy exams which meant my tertiary education for  
pharmacy completed."
ISEAR_3137	3137	"When I was in a car with my parents and friends and we had to  
back up (reverse) pass a river which when I recall it (I was only  
about 5 yrs) seemed we were going to fall in and drown."
ISEAR_3138	3138	"When my boyfriend wouldn't dance with me on my graduation night

ISEAR_3142	3142	"When I had to go to reconciliation before converting to  
Catholicism but then once received - o.k."
ISEAR_3143	3143	"Joy for me is when all my family gather around home for special  
occasions as Christmas etc. It really gives me joy to see my  
family and relatives and to observe natures productivity process  
which have been going on for centuries."
ISEAR_3144	3144	"I had this experience of fear when few people were fighting at a  
social one night, which one of my relative was involved. My fear  
was greatly for him because he was being assaulted badly."
ISEAR_3145	3145	Never really had the experience just yet - N/A.
ISEAR_3146	3146	"This occurred when my girlfriend and I have to finish our  
relationship due to some circumstances between her and her  
family. I was really sad, hurt and couldn't really find any  
reason why am I still living. Is this life is all about ? This  
was one of few question which crept up vividly every time I  
thought about what had happened."
ISEAR_3147	3147	"I'm very disgusted when I see people abusing their body with  
drugs and alcohol. They take advantage of these things usually  
for an excuse for the fantasies which they like and so they do  
things stupidly and unjustly."
ISEAR_3148	3148	NO RESPONSE.
ISEAR_3149	3149	This I experienced when going around with more than one girl.

ISEAR_3156	3156	"When I had to lie about my age to be accepted as a member of a  
group."
ISEAR_3157	3157	"My cousin asked me to be a bridesmaid for her. This made really  
happy because I was adopted into the family and her asking me  
made me realise that she saw me as a cousin and not just another  
person. There were other cousins she could have asked but she  
asked me."
ISEAR_3158	3158	"That if ever I was really naughty I would be sent away from my  
Mum and Dad to another family. I was fostered from age 5 and  
didn't get to Mum and Dad until I was 6 and then legally adopted  
at 14."
ISEAR_3159	3159	"(1) My father died. (2) My natural father contacted me a year  
after my father died and this angered me more as I thought he  
should be dead and not my father."
ISEAR_3160	3160	"My father died. I was away at the time and did not know until two  
days after."
ISEAR_3161	3161	"A child told me she had been sexually abused by her step-father.  
I only knew the child and had not come into contact with either  
parent. I tried to do what was best for the child. The event and  
the stepfather disgusted me."
ISEAR_3162	3162	"When my natural parents name would show up on papers and not my,

friend of mine in public."

relationship was new, fresh, vital etc. once again."
ISEAR_3172	3172	"My daughter was 2 yrs she went up to a colt tried to hit it. It  
turned on her and kicked her over the heart, sent her flying  
through the air. I left my mother and sister to deal to her as  
they are nurses. I felt I didn't want to know if she was going to  
die, it was just too much."
ISEAR_3173	3173	My anger is with men, their inability to be human (not all men).
ISEAR_3174	3174	"The saddest I've ever been was when my lover was killed,

priviledge. Not using it positively."
ISEAR_3177	3177	"When I betrayed my lover, she told me something in confidence, I  
felt at the time I had to relay the information back to the  
person concerned, as I felt the situation volitile, did this  
without telling my lover, she felt like piggy in the middle, as  
she was not directly concerned. Maybe you could call it gossip I  
felt different after I had slept on it. If I had waited, thought,  
NOW I would not have done it."
ISEAR_3178	3178	"A good friend, the wife of the vicar of my church came up to me  
from the pews (I am in the choir) and shook my hand during the  
time for an informal ""greeting"" in the church service. She said a  
few words."
ISEAR_3179	3179	"I walked up the main street of Auckland at 10 o'clock at night. I

thought it was actually quite quiet, though also oppressive. I  
walked about half a mile and bought a drink along the way."
ISEAR_3180	3180	"Someone in my family (my brother I suspected) ate a bun which I

had just made it and put it in the oven warming drawer."
ISEAR_3181	3181	"Sitting in a bus, I heard behind, the voice of a girl I was  
friendly with. After her talking for some time with another girl  
I decided it wasn't her in fact that someone miming her, which it  
was when I finally looked. I was talking to a friend at the time."
ISEAR_3182	3182	"Having moved into a flat within the last week I felt some disgust  
that a bathroom tap had been left to drip with a faulty fawcet."
ISEAR_3183	3183	"I criticised an action of my mother and for the first time she  
genuinely took notice of it. I felt shame that I was almost  
taking the part of a husband, or at least an equal which I should  
not."
ISEAR_3184	3184	"I felt that I contributed to a possible rift in the relationship

be rude to refuse again. Was really afraid of what he might do."
ISEAR_3187	3187	"I live by myself and a few weeks ago was woke by a man on the end  
of my bed coming up my bed at me. I was really angry, told him to  
get out. He was surprised, hesitated; I started to move towards  
him and he backed off - kept telling him - loudly, but firmly to  
go. Because I'd got the initiative, I succeeded. A very powerful  
message."
ISEAR_3188	3188	"When my grandmother died - I wasn't sad so much that she'd died  
because she was old, but because she lived in the last few years  
in an old people's home and had nothing very much that was hers -  
no chair, or private space, and when I went to visit she would be  
sitting in the ""lliving"" room the TV room. It was hopeless. And I  
felt awkward so I didn't go and I was sad 'cos how I couldn't."

pushbike as a little boy - all alone, lost and surrounded by  
smouldering wood and flame."

my financial, physical, spiritual and emotional needs will be  
well catered for. This position fulfils a lot of my aims for the  
last five years of my life."
ISEAR_3216	3216	"When I decided to leave my steady, secure employment to come to  
university. Because I didn't know if I could cope with all the  
requirements of study and also being older I didn't know if I  
would enjoy mixing with younger people, also financial  
insecurity."
ISEAR_3217	3217	"When a close friend failed to live up to the expectations I had  
of him - thereby causing pain to his spouse. I believe that my

live up to my own expectations."

sharing in the sorrow of her parents who were left behind."

unwillingness to challenge him about these attitudes in order to  
keep the peace."

party I wanted to go - instead I was going out with my family. A  
guy called and said, in effect, that I was ""nice"" and he liked  
me. Hence the emotional joy."
ISEAR_3237	3237	"I was watching a movie alone - it was a horror movie. The music

on and off. It was in the complete darkness of a movie theatre  
that was almost empty."

really hurt her."

engaged."

nothing would happen to me, yet there was this slight feeling of  
fear."
ISEAR_5899	5899	"Uncleaniness at my work place.  The place is generally not very  
clean, but when it reaches a point, I get angry at the person  
who is supposed to clean the place and the people who are  
supposed to supervise him."
ISEAR_5900	5900	"Three weeks ago a friend of mine bid me good-bye before going

for a long time."
ISEAR_5901	5901	"When we complained about the uncleanliness of the work place, the

days nothing had been done.  I felt disgusted at the whole  
situation."
ISEAR_5902	5902	"I got into a tight pair of trousers and examined myself in the

visiting hours.  This disgusted me."
ISEAR_5922	5922	"Once I was not able to give a relative, who was in a critical  
period, a helping hand.  Whenever I think about it I feel guilty

me and I had never imagined that he could do such a thing."

one of the teachers gave private coaching classes to some girls  
and she would give these girls extra attention in class and would

teachers and friends."

journey recently from Calcutta to Bombay.  It was very boring and  
tiring."
ISEAR_5949	5949	"I remember that once, a friend did not co-operate with me due to  
some unavoidable reasons.  Unaware of this I treated her unjustly  
till I realized everything, and then I felt ashamad of my deeds. "
ISEAR_5950	5950	"I did badly in one of the vital exams, despite getting proper

could have avoided."
ISEAR_5953	5953	"The day I was happiest was the day when I received a phone call  
from Eve's Weekly to inform me that I had won the first prize of  
the All India Essay competition.  I had won this prize when I was  
an under-graduate when even post graduates had participated.  I  
had been judged by eminent judges and political scientists."
ISEAR_5954	5954	"Fear is an emotion that I experience very often.  Naturally this  
is during exams and subsequently while waiting for the results.   
However there is one occassion when I was paralyzed with fear.   
This was when I was doing my M.A.-I, and we had a series of student  
lectures.  I was one of the participants and my lecture happened  
to be the opening lecture.  I had been confident all morning, about  
twenty minutes before the lecture, my confidence started failing  
me.  I felt my heart go cold, my lips go dry and I was really  
paralyzed.  This incident of fear is still fresh."
ISEAR_5955	5955	"I experience this emotion quite often but the day I was most  
angry was the day I got pulled up for something I had not done.   
It happened during my school days, I had not spoken a word in  
class but the monitor had written my name on the board.  So I  
had a remark in my callender which I had to get signed by my  
parents.  This remark resulted in me being spanked."
ISEAR_5956	5956	"I have once been very sad and lonely.  This was when I was trying  
to organize a play as a student (15 years).  Instead of  
materializing, it fizzled out.  The worst thing was that the play  
fell apart completely and I found myself weeping uncontrollably.   
Now when I think of it, I laugh it off; but at that time it was  
intense."
ISEAR_5957	5957	"This is an incident that many of us witness in our everyday life  
in a city like Bombay.  One day I was travelling by bus, three  
men dragged two fellows out of the bus.  Once outside they were  
beaten into pulp.  These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets  
and they were being beaten by all and sundry.  I thought to  
myself -""what is life?"".  It is one hell of a place where  
everyone is after someone else.  One waits to cut the throat of  
the other one just for a living, (money).  When I think about  
such things - the purpose of life, etc, I feel very disgusted and  
dejected."
ISEAR_5958	5958	"This is an event I will never forget.  I am considered a good  
mimic.  This particular day we were waiting for a professor  
to take her class.  This  professor had a peculiar accent and a  
very horrible way of lecturing and to top it all we had this  
class at the fag end of the day.  So this particular day I got  
into my element and started imitating the professor, and the  
professor entered the class right in the middle of it .  I was  
unaware of her presence, some of my friends tried to warn me but  
it was of no avail as I was too engrossed in mimicing.  Then I  
suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her  
entering the class.  I do not know till today if she actually saw  
what I had been doing or she had completely ignored it.  Through   
out that lecture I died of shame.  All the more shameful was the  
fact that she gave me a character certificate. "
ISEAR_5959	5959	"This happened when it was finally confirmed that I had stood  
first in the university for the M.A exams.  A few days before the  
official results were declared a clerk had brought the results  
unofficially.  So I had been expecting the results but the  
confirmation allowed me to legitimately feel happy at my  
success.  
"
ISEAR_5960	5960	"This was when I was being followed home every day from the campus,  
by a stranger.  He would follow me to the campus and then sit  
outside my class.  If I was not there he would ask my friends as  
to where I was.  He was a dark, ominous looking person and I was  
terrified of him as I did not know his intentions.  I reported  
him to the security officer, who turned him over to the police.   
I was even more petrified then."
ISEAR_5961	5961	"A new gas connection was to be installed and the mechanic who came  
to do it was very rude to my mother and me.  I rushed to thhe  
dealer with my mother and had a fight with the dealer as he  
seemed to be unreasonable and was taking the mechanic's side.   
Ultimately the matter was resolved after my father went and spoke  
to him.  The mechanic was asked to apologize."
ISEAR_5962	5962	"The day I was to receive my gold-medal for the M.A, my  
grandmother, who I loved very much, died after an illness.  She   
died a few hours before the convocation.  While I was  
attending the convocation I had to control my grief as she would  
not have liked me to miss it.  It was a day she had been waiting  
for, but did not get to see. "
ISEAR_5963	5963	"We had come back from a programme and we were all (three girls)     
staying over at another girls placce.  One of them started  
passing very nasty and outright bitchy remarks at me.  It was  
brought on by a male colleague's compliments to me, this girl was  
herself interested in this guy.  Bitchiness and catty remarks  
made by women never fail to disgust me.  I can particularly  
remember this incident as she knew that I had not encouraged the   
guy."
ISEAR_5964	5964	"I was learning judo and my instructor wanted me to assist him in  
teaching girls judo at a suburban college.  I was just a beginer,  
and he made me a green belt so that I would be able to command  
respect.  This was against my principles, and yet I allowed myself  
to listen to him.  I gave it up soon after, however I felt very  
ashamed at not sticking to my principles and at not having put my  
foot down earlier."
ISEAR_5965	5965	"I was coming back home with my mother when the purse I was  
carrying got stolen.  It was done so swifty that I did not  
realize what had happened till much later.  A lot of money and the  
keys of the house were lost.  I was guilt ridden at my  
carelessness.  I felt terrible as I do not normally loose things  
and this was quite important, especially the keys.

70% of the Indian poulation is still below the poverty line."
ISEAR_5977	5977	"I read about the national and social spirit and self-discipline  
of the people of developed coutries like U.S.A, England, France,  
Germany etc.  Comparing this to the Indian people I felt guilty  
as they have no national spirit or self-discipline."
ISEAR_5978	5978	"I felt happy at the settlement of our marriage, even though we  
are from different socio-linguistic backgrounds our parents  
agreed to the wedding without any conflict or discussion.  We had   
thought that they would object to the wedding but it did not happen. "
ISEAR_5979	5979	"One day, early morning my mother who is healthy fell ill.  There  
was no doctor or compounder near by and for a few hours -8 A.M to  
6 P.M she did not speak a single sentence, nor did she drink water  
or  milk.  There was no movement in her body and I felt really  
scared.  I almost lost my confidence about her survival."
ISEAR_5980	5980	"One day my elder brother badly scolded my father.  This was the  
first time that I heard such abusive language from my brother.  I  
requested him humbly not to use this kind of language but he did  
not care for what I was saying.  Finally I picked up an axe to use  
against him, in the meanwhile people intervened."
ISEAR_5981	5981	"My close friend and I applied to TISS for admission last year,  
unfortunately he failed to get admission.  We had done our graduation  
together and are quite involved with each other, so we had wanted  
to do our Masters degree together.  However, it did not work out  
as we had expected it to and this saddened me."
ISEAR_5982	5982	"My classmate at TISS has the habit of biting his nails and ever  
since my childhood I have never liked this habit.  This person is  
near me in class, dining hall and the campus so I suggested that  
he should stop biting his nails.  However he found it difficult  
and my disgust feelings have not changed."
ISEAR_5983	5983	"I had this feeling before my graduation and never dared to speak  
to my relatives and  friends.  Because of this feeling I would  
avoid situations, however I do not know the reason for this."
ISEAR_5984	5984	"One day my mother forced me to eat more and I refused, the next  
day she served me more rice and mutton pieces than usual.  When I

Later I felt guilty and asked her to excuse me."

ISEAR_5986	5986	"When I was in my village one of my enemies had written a

the girl's father was a worse man."
ISEAR_5987	5987	"When I was doing research a few months ago, I had asked the

ISEAR_5991	5991	"One of my friends came to know through some other friends that I

ISEAR_5995	5995	"The death of Jaya Prakash Narayan caused a great deal of sadness  
as I believed that he was the only true democrat and a ray of  
hope on the Indian horizon."

the part of us ( educated few) for the lack of drive and drive  
towards their redemption. ]"
ISEAR_5997	5997	"When I realized that I belonged to a country which is amongst the

train.  I finally made it."
ISEAR_6001	6001	"I felt angry when repeated pleas to the ticket collector and the

to talk to her anymore.

ISEAR_7187	7187	"Once when I had started to write a paper, there was a phone

dare and did not want to look, just walked by them quickly.  The  
interest of talking to A disappeared and I just wanted to remain

to F.  I should have expected this to happen."
ISEAR_7194	7194	"Knowing that I had to do the survey with him I felt very

students who were late."

secondary school and she would not be disappointed and gloomy  
because of me."

poor - far from what I had expected.   I thought that I would not  
be accepted at the university."
ISEAR_7215	7215	"I am disgusted by people who spoil their identity because of  
misbehaviour.  This morning when I was in a crowded bus, I found  
a seat on which a university student was sitting on one side and  
he had put his bag and files next to him.  There was very little  
space left and I sat down while he kept on reading.  Even when I

I felt very angry."

fish as a fisherman had already put his net there.  We pulled

the net to earn a living and we had had thrown it."
ISEAR_7218	7218	"I had a very close friend who went to Canada after her F.B, his   
departure was unavoidable.  When he came back during the Summer  
holidays I was very happy as nothing had changed between us."
ISEAR_7219	7219	"The day before the university results came out I was both excited  
and scared.  If I failed I did not know what I would do as I did  
not want to work, my family was ambivalent."
ISEAR_7220	7220	"Before the certificate examination I was very poor in Biology  
(the worst result in my class).  Ever since F.5 it had been  
getting poorer and poorer.  I had tried my best and had spent  
most of my time studying this subject.  Finally my results were  
so bad that I thought that it was just not fair."
ISEAR_7221	7221	"My cat died from an illness.  It had been with us for 7 years.   
It was a lovely cat.  It had been ill for one or two weeks and  
the veterinary surgeon had told us that it was dying."
ISEAR_7222	7222	"In secondary school I had a class-mate who talked too much.    
Once we went to the cinema after school and she sat next to me and  
commented the movie throughout  - very disgusting."
ISEAR_7223	7223	"Our teacher had invited us to lunch and once at the canteen we  
started introducing ourselves.  Two of the boys showed a lot of  
interest in knowing personal details and then they started  
talking about some activities held in the college.  I had little  
interest in those activities so I talked to another student  
sitting next to me as I was afraid that they would ask me  
questions on those activities."
ISEAR_7224	7224	"My younger sister wanted to take classes to learn a musical  
instrument.  One Saturday morning my mother asked me to go with         
her for the registration.  I did not want to go  so I said that  
there might be many bad people at the club.  As a resullt my  
sister was scolded by my mother."

instructors would have a meeting the advisor would be present.   
He did not understand our worknig conditions but talked a lot  
and had a lot of outdated ideas.  Whenever we disagreed with him  
he was very discontent and said that we had a prejudice against  
him.  Why did he have to treat us as his subordinates ?"
ISEAR_7237	7237	"When we received  our academic result I learnt that my  results

accquaintances were good and when they asked me about my results  
I really did not want to answer."
ISEAR_7238	7238	"When I was fighting with my elder brother I unintentionally hurt

dark as there were no street lamps.  I ran in the dark, very  
scared, I ran as fast as possible."
ISEAR_7255	7255	"I separated with the one I liked most.  She refused all my dates  
and told me that she had dated another one.  My heart seemed to  
cease beating.  I was silent for some time and then I whispered  
goodbye and left without turning back."
ISEAR_7256	7256	"When I was a teacher in an evening school, a girl raised a lot of  
questions and expressed her opinions.  She, very often, took a  
stand which was different from mine and she thought that it  
was better than mine.  Her opinions were helpful academically, but   
she did not take into consideration my position in public.  Also  
she seemed to be very talkative and so she disgusted me."
ISEAR_7257	7257	"I had lunch in a restaurant with a friend and I paid the bill.

people sitting next to me talked to each other for 20 minutes.   
There were no other seats so I could not go elsewhere and I did    
not want to interrupt them, so I could only be angry in my heart."
ISEAR_7262	7262	"I had been separated from my girlfriend for about a year.  On her  
birthday I put a present in her mailbox.  I had spent two days  
choosing a suitable present for her.  I waited for a few days and  
there was no reply from her; at last I received a thank-you card  
in my mailbox.  On the card there was only my name, the words thank-you   
and her signature.  I was very sad then."
ISEAR_7263	7263	"When I was travelling to school by bus, I went past a place  
where a sewer had been repaired.  There was a bad strong smell  
which suffocated me and I wanted to leave the place immediately."

recently changed his major subject.    I felt very ashamed."

guilt as I had not kept my promise."

was very happy and satified."

I had to go for her class. "

shared had been eaten up by him (I ate little)."

been prejudiced against her, this was an extreme thought."
ISEAR_7277	7277	"When I was giving private tutorials to my student; he would not

to read and my teacher did not accept my work as it was handed in

2C.  I felt satisfied with the results and was happy."

anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern   
and when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not  
pay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others  
argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two  
hours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and  
could not reach a compromise.  My classmates avoided doing the  
work and the responsibilities, they seemed to value other  
projects more than this one."

other's point of view."

afraid of his misunderstanding me and being hurt and angry at me.

opportunity to apologize."
ISEAR_7329	7329	"I remember my religious experience.  During  a gospel camp, a few  
friends of mine decided to believe in God.  The joy that I felt  
at that time was more than words can express.  I blessed them and  
praised God in my heart."
ISEAR_7330	7330	"My friend and I had offended our classmate unintenionally.  We  
wanted to apologize to her so we decided to visit her.  We knew that she  
was stubborn so we were frightened.  When we rang her door bell,  
our fear was at it's climax"

disgusting."
ISEAR_7334	7334	"Once in primary five, I had forgotten to take a book to class and  
the teacher punished me by asking me to stand at the back of the  
class.  I thought about the way my mother would react if she saw  
me being punished.  My mother was very good to me and though she  
did not see me punished, I felt sorry for her."
ISEAR_7335	7335	"I had fixed a meeting with my classmates and I missed it as I was  
tired.  Besides everyone at the meeting was a stranger to me and  
I did not want to make friends with them.  Whatever the reasons - I   
felt guilty."
ISEAR_7336	7336	"I learnt from the newspaper that I had been accepted at the  
Chinese university of H.K.  It was 7 o'clock in the morning.   
Later I told my family and relatives about it and had tea with  
them very joyfully."
ISEAR_7337	7337	"I was camping in an old broken hut which had no lights.  I had  
brought along a lamp which was not working very well.  The door  
made strange sounds and I was sure that strange things were  
happening.  The most terrifying bit was that there were many  
wardrobes in the hut and everytime that I looked in the glass of  
the wardrobe I felt that there were ""objects"" behind me.   The  
whole night was spent in fear and restlessness."
ISEAR_7338	7338	"During a football match, the other team was rude and they hurt my

the match had to be cut short."

mine (a boy's name).  I realized my mistake only when I went up  
to the stage for the prize.  I did not know what to do as  
everyone was looking at me.  I blushed and went back to my seat."
ISEAR_7342	7342	"While playing basketball I broke a team member's spectacles.  His  
face was injured by the  pieces of glass.  It was not serious but  
I felt guilty and blamed myself for being too careless and  
vigorous in my game."
ISEAR_7343	7343	"After a busy day I went back to my hostel.  I closed the door and  
had a drink, then I read my favourite book on the bed.  Suddenly  
I felt peace and joy."
ISEAR_7344	7344	"When I went home and there was nobody, I waited till 2 A.M and       
still nobody.  I was suddenly scared and anxious as this had never  
happened before.  In addition my mother was very weak and I  
feared that she had met with an accident.  Therefore I was anxious   
all night."
ISEAR_7345	7345	"Yesterday I read in the newspaper that a 30 year old woman had  
abused her 2 month old son and had caused his death.  I was very  
angry after reading this as this is not a human act and to abuse  
so fragile a life is not a forgivable sin."
ISEAR_7346	7346	"I had a schoolmate who went to the hospital as her brain was  
bleeding.  She fell unconscious for three days and when I went  
to see her I saw the miserable state the family was in.  Moreover  
I could not do nothing for her.  I was very sad.  Finally, she  
died."
ISEAR_7347	7347	"A tiresome person held me up all day long.  I was very busy then  
(I can not remember what the problem was).  He continously tried  
to make me talk to him and disturbed me."
ISEAR_7348	7348	"One day, when I was sitting on the bus, there was an old woman  
standing beside me.  I was very tired and sleepy and did not  
think of giving her my seat.  A 50 year old woman who was sitting  
beside me got up and gave her seat to the old woman and said,   
"" Old woman, please take my seat, the youngstters these days are  
not used to giving their seats to others.""  When I heard these  
words I was very ashamed of myself and wanted to get off the bus  
at once.  "
ISEAR_7349	7349	"After an exam I was in a very bad mood as I had done it very        
badly.  At home, my mother took so long to ask me how things had   
gone that I lost my temper.  I overreacted and made my mother cry.  
She still prepared lunch for me and did not scold me .  Suddenly,  
I thought that it was my fault and I started crying.   
"
ISEAR_7350	7350	"I was appreciated by others, especially my family members and my  
friends."
ISEAR_7351	7351	"Whenever I am alone in a dark room, walk alone on the street,  
sleep alone in the room at night or see something which is only  
partly visible.  This emotion was very strong when as an 8 year    
old child I saw something horrible.  "
ISEAR_7352	7352	"[ Whenever I put myself in other's shoes and try to make the  
person happy, comfort him or make friends and I am misunderstood  
and rejected, especially when this person is a family member or a friend.]"
ISEAR_7353	7353	"There was a conflict of interest between me and a close friend of  
mine.  He only thought about his own interest and not about our  
friendship.  This behaviour hurt his friends.  Another incident  
is when a friend isolated himself without giving any reasons."
ISEAR_7354	7354	When I saw a lot of rubbish and animal waste on the floor.
ISEAR_7355	7355	"When I was emotionally unstable I said things which may have hurt  
others or made them feel unhappy.  When I calmed down I realized  
that I had been selfish and had not taken into consideration the  
feelings of others.  Then I felt ashamed as someone pointed out my  
behaviour to me."
ISEAR_7356	7356	"[ When I break someone's things out of carelessness, or do something   
to make others feel unhappy  or hurt the self-esteem / self-confidence   
of others, especially if they happen to be friends or family members.]"
ISEAR_7357	7357	"When I received the letter informing that I had been accepted to  
be a Chinese university student, I was excited as I had longed  
for it."
ISEAR_7358	7358	"One day when I was a little boy, my friends asked me to play  
with them outside and to catch some boys.  However our parents  
did not know that we were out and when I got home it was very  
late and I feared being scolded by my parents."
ISEAR_7359	7359	"When I learnt that a friend of mine had talked about me to  
another friend and had said wrong things about my abilities and  
attitudes.  I was very angry."
ISEAR_7360	7360	"About two years ago my girlfriend suggested that we separate.   
This really gave me a shock as I had never thought that she would  
say such things.  The reason she gave me was that we were not  
suited for each other."
ISEAR_7361	7361	"Once while studying for my exam I found so many complicated words  
that it disgusted me."
ISEAR_7362	7362	"When I was young I felt ashamed when our relatives visited us and  
I hid myself."
ISEAR_7363	7363	"I was so excited once that I told my classmate that she was old,  
this hurt her and I felt guilty."
ISEAR_7364	7364	"[ During a certain period, I felt successful and extremely satisfied.    
When I found that any tasks or decisions that I had made were better   
than expected.]"
ISEAR_7365	7365	I am scared when I stroll alone on the Chung Chi college campus. 
ISEAR_7366	7366	"One day, I discussed a very important question with A.  A  
suddenly declared that he would not accept my position and  
thought that he himself was right.  Moreover, he attacked   
strongly, not my opinion but me personally."
ISEAR_7367	7367	"When I learnt that I had failed an exam,  This not only influenced  
my emotions but also other important tasks, it also made my  
record imperfect."
ISEAR_7368	7368	"[ I would classify subjectively, a certain gesture or the way of  
talking of a person as disgusting or inacceptable.]"
ISEAR_7369	7369	"One day I felt dizzy during a lecture.  When the lecturer asked  
us as to who had heard the fairy tale - I was the only one who  
put up his hand and this surprised the whole class."
ISEAR_7370	7370	"We always made a lot of noise during a certain lecture.  This may  
have been because we did not respect the lecturer. Finaly, the  
lecturer could not tolerate it and he scolded us angrily and  
pointed out our misbehaviour."
ISEAR_7371	7371	"I felt happy when I received the letter telling me that I had  
been admitted to the university."
ISEAR_7372	7372	"During the first year in university I had bad results in both  
the terms, especially the first term.  I was afraid that  I would  
not be promoted to the next year and that the others would go  
ahead of me."
ISEAR_7373	7373	Once my father slapped my mother for a small quarrel.
ISEAR_7374	7374	"A few years ago my mother suffered from canccer and died within  
two years.  We had not finished our studies then and could not  
bear our responsibilities as her children.  My mother had tried  
her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two  
years.  Neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as  
cancer is incurable.  I was very eager to replace her in  
suffernig , even die instead of her."
ISEAR_7375	7375	"I used to play with a group of classmates and I found out later  
that they were cheap in thought, behaviour and conduct - they  
would smoke, fight and speak foul language.  I thought that they  
destroyed the image of college students."
ISEAR_7376	7376	"It was discovered that I had received a warning letter as my  
G.P.A was very low."
ISEAR_7377	7377	"Many years back I quarrelled with my younger brother for a small  
reason.  I used a pole to beat him and nearly broke his arm.  He  
recovered after a treatment which lasted several months.  After  
this our relationship was worse and he would not listen to me."
ISEAR_7378	7378	"One Saturday afternoon, I deliberately dressed up nicely (I had  
been in a bad mood of late).  I hoped to go for a walk in the  
soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.  When I was having  
lunch in the canteen, two of my male classmates asked me as to  
why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me  
before).  One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would  
look very nice if we wore them together."
ISEAR_7379	7379	"The exam was drawing near and I wanted to prepare for it.  But I  
had a lot of other things to do so I did not have much time to prepare   
for the exams.  Whenever I sat down to study I was scared that I would   
not be able to finish it."
ISEAR_7380	7380	"A female classmate was always late for meetings which were for  
the homework and not social gatherings.  We were very busy and  
the deadline was close but we had to waste half an hour or an  
hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then."
ISEAR_7381	7381	"After a meeting ended we started talking about when we would  
have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and  
could not have a meeting in between, I thought that they would  
understand this as they had always done).  They did not  
understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many  
other activities.  Their reaction made me burst into tears."
ISEAR_7382	7382	"When I was studying in the library a pair of lovers were sitting  
next to me talking in an intense and soft voice.  They were  
disturbing others."
ISEAR_7383	7383	"During an informal discussion I contributed a lot even though I  
had not spent much time studying.  Whenever someone said that  
someone was not paying attention, or that he had too many other  
things to do, or that the persoon was not trying his best, I  
would feel ashamed."
ISEAR_7384	7384	"Our class had organized a picnic in November.  I was the class  
representative so I became the organizor.  However the picnic  
was postponed by one week and I had something else to do then.  
Initially I did not ponder on what to do and decided to go for  
the picnic.  When I had the time to think about it I thought that  
my decision was wrong.  My classmates thought that I would go as  
I had signed my name but I did not go.  I told another class  
representative that I was not going but he did not know the  
reason behind my not going.  After the picnic my classmates asked  
me why I had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone  
mentioned it I was apologetic.  I should have decided right in  
the begining that I would not go and then they would not see me  
as irresponsible i.e promising to go and changing my mind  
afterwards."
ISEAR_7385	7385	"It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W).  It was  
during the first term Summer vacations.  We met each other while  
handing in our homework.  He invited me have a trip with him and  
we were together till 8 P.M."
ISEAR_7386	7386	"The day the results of the certificate exam came out.  I went to  
school and at first I did not feel frightened.  By the time I  
reached the fourth floor ( the results were being given on the  
fifth floor) I found it difficult to walk and felt that I would  
die."
ISEAR_7387	7387	"One day I had sunned my favourite shirt and was putting it back  
in the wardrobe when my younger brother snatched it from me and  
wore it.  He had not had a bath and was very dirty.  I scolded him  
but he answered back and locked himself up in a room.  I was very  
angry so I starteed kicking on the door and abusing him loudly  
and freely."
ISEAR_7388	7388	"When I was a child I was playing on the upper deck of the bed  
with my brother.  My parents slept on the lower deck.  My father  
felt disgusted and beat me up.  I felt very sad as my father had  
never beaten me or scolded me before."
ISEAR_7389	7389	"My boyfriend and I did not have any contact with each other during   
the Summer holidays.  I met him the day of the registration and looked   
through him.  In the canteen he asked me if I wanted to have a drink and   
I said no as I did not want him to do me a favour."
ISEAR_7390	7390	"On Christmas eve I went to a classmate's home with other  
classmates.  The next morning when I came out of the toilet she  
said something and I did not understand what she was saying.   
When she pointed at my trousers I discovered that I had forgotten  
to zip them up.  I rushed back to the toilet but by the time the  
others had guessed what had happened."
ISEAR_7391	7391	"One night,when I was in primary 5 or 6, I felt thirsty so I  
fetched the thermos to pour a cup of water for myself.  Then I  
saw my brother lowering his head and I, jokingly, poured the        
water on his head."

We were in a flurry but at that time I felt the love and concern  
of my friends."
ISEAR_7393	7393	"I was on a trip to Phillipines during Summer and I was staying in  
a hotel.  The room I was staying in was very silent and had very  
dim lights.  The last night I felt frightened and lay awake - I  
could hear some sounds around me and dared not open my eyes - I  
waited for dawn."
ISEAR_7394	7394	"I had a very good friend in secondary school.  The year after our  
graduation I prepared to celebrate her birthday and I called off  
all my appointments.  I got together the other friends and we  
were ready to give the entire day to her.  However this friend  
disappeared on her birthday.  When I phoned another friend I  
didcovered thay she was busy, I did not call her anymore."
ISEAR_7395	7395	"I am a Christian but I cannot find any meaning in life . It  
seems that I am deceiving myself but I cannot find the way out."
ISEAR_7396	7396	"A brother from one of the Christian fellowship often phoned me  
and talked to me for half an hour or more.  However there was  
nothing important in the conversation and I found the person very  
disgusting."
ISEAR_7397	7397	I felt shame when I found that I was almost last in the exam.
ISEAR_7398	7398	"Once I bought my sister a pair of sports shoes as she was going  
to join an athletic meet.  However the shoes were a little big  
and had a few flaws.  She muttered all the way and blamed me for  
having wasted her money anf I felt guilty."

One day my sister lent her book to a friend without telling my  
mother about it.  When my mother learnt this she beat her up and  
even threatened her with a pair of scissors.  "

I felt sad about the coming several years."

She treated us strictly and punished us physically.   These

candidature number."

went off and we talked about ghost stories and I thought that  
there were ghosts."

master said that my conduct was good and asked me to tell him the  
names of those who had taken part in it.   I replied that I did  
not know."

youth center with a few other volunteers.  I was the head of the  
organizors and we spent over a month planning it.  During this  
period we got to know and understood each other.  We  
discovered each others potential and we planned many interesting  
things for the carnival.  The day of the carnival everything was  
bright, the programmes went well and the attendants enjoyed it.   
I felt extremely excited about it."
ISEAR_7421	7421	"I was a prefect at secondary school.  On the sports day I told  
others that I would take down the names of the people who  
misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.   
Suddenly the head prefect came and scolded me in front of others.  
 I was very angry as there were other prefects sitting and he  
picked on me.  I thought that a brief rest was not  serious  
enough to be blamed."
ISEAR_7422	7422	"I had joined a youth group that observed the affairs of our  
community and so I had many opportunities to contact the  
government and the committee members of the district board (a  
local executive structure).  We always tried to consult and  
discuss with them, but we found that such people did not  
understand community affairs and they even dampened our  
enthusiasm in local affairs.  I did not understand why they had  
decided to work as community leaders."
ISEAR_7423	7423	"One day I was the leader of the weekly meeting of the Church  
fellowship.  That day I had been preparing for the exams and did

meeting badly.  I was ashamed of myself.  "

examination and I promised to give it back to her in two days  
time.  I was very busy at that time and forgot many things; as I  
was not very often at home she could not contact me.  When I  
started my revision I realized that her notebook had been on my  
desk for five days.  I contacted her immediately and gave it back  
to her.  Though she did not say anything I felt very guilty."

know what to do ."
ISEAR_7427	7427	"When I got into a bus I found that my wallet had been stolen.  
It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I  
lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to  
spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always  
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I  
suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil  
servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a  
criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with  
them."

had to go to hospital.  When my mother  came to see me I felt  
guilty as I had not listened to her and I had to soon sit for a  
public examination."
ISEAR_7432	7432	"After attending a song contest proposed by a band called ""Chyne""  
we (6 of us) waited for the members of the band to greet us in  
front of the stage.  We went out after a few minutes as it was  
time to close the hall.  We had been waiting at the entrance hall  
for ten minutes when three of the band members came out.  They  
were very excited to see us, one of them was so excited that he  
had tears in his eyes.  We felt very warm and close to each  
other.  They took us back into the hall and we talked freely.  We  
were together for about an hour and during this time we felt  
that they were very sincere."
ISEAR_7433	7433	"At noon one Sunday I received a phone call telling me that my  
mother had been knocked down by a car at the street crossing and

boxes.  However I immediately ran to the scene of the accident."

should have been very happy; however my grandmother, because of   
her prejudice and misunderstanding, started a  quarrel with my  
mother.  She expected me to take her side and she deliberately  
talked of my mother's wrong doings.  I was very angry because -

should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new  
house that day."
ISEAR_7435	7435	"When I was in lower six class during the Summer I joined a

travelling in mainland China and he got T.B.  He died a few weeks  
after coming back to H.K.  We all got together for the funeral  
and when I looked at the body for the last time I felt extremely  
sad."
ISEAR_7436	7436	"During these Summer vacations a schoolmate who was not in my  
class went to Britain.  Before he left, his classmates and some  
of us who were accquainted with him had a B.B.Q on the beach.   
When I arrived I saw that some people , who were not close  
friends of the departing person(person A), were playing mahjong.   
Some others were playing bridge and A had nothing to do, besides  
it was A who had prepared the food.  Later when we wanted to talk  
and his classmates did not even have the decency to listen to him.   
They only asked him a few questions half-heartedly and then they  
talked on their own.  Some of their conversation was against me and   
another classmate."
ISEAR_7437	7437	"When I was in lower six I joined an interview group to  
interview the general public.  One of my friends in the group  
lost her purse and she was very nervous.  Five of us had to go  
another place so we left her, and planned to see her later.  Then  
I heard her describing how her purse looked.  I realized that I  
had seen her purse on the floor and had not wanted to do any  
thing about it. "
ISEAR_7438	7438	"I went to a friend's baptism as she became a Christian after me  
and I realized that she was more enthusiastic about her spiritual  
life than I was.  When I was with my brothers and sisters of  
Christ I had a guilty feeling which could not be dismissed  
easily.  When pepole asked me as to when I would be baptised my  
guilt feeling deepened."
ISEAR_7439	7439	"When I received the result slip of the higher level examination  
(an university entrance exam) and saw that I had a very good

classmates.  "

time.  "
ISEAR_7443	7443	"A few days back I was waiting for the bus at the bus stop.   
Before getting into the bus I had prepared the exact amount of  
coins to pay for the bus fair and when I got into the bus I put  
these coins into the box meant to collect the bus fair.  I  
thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside.  However the  
bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins  
were stuck at the opening  of the box.  He had not seen me paying  
and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box.  I could not  
understand this and the driver kept questioning me.  He made me  
feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just  
to get away from him.  Later I found that I had forgotten a few  
coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first  
time.  After I had entered the bus I could still hear him  
scolding me and I felt disgusted."
ISEAR_7444	7444	"A few days back I had a tutorial class and the teacher randomly  
assigned one person in each group to make a presentation.  The  
discussion in our group had been confused and the presentation  
was not very well prepared.  Unfortunately I was selected to  
present and I could not keep calm, was confused and result was  
very poor.  I really felt ashamed."
ISEAR_7445	7445	"Once I quarrelled with my sister and after this I deliberately  
messed up her belongings."
ISEAR_7446	7446	"I had a dream : I had a very close friend who had several stone  
houses in the New Territories (villages) but they did not have  
much furniture.  He took me to see his fields (I had never seen  
them before) and there were several inches of clear water on  
which the sunshine was reflected.  I wanted to sit among the  
short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the  
plants to death.  My friend said ""They will not die"" and I sat  
down happily and my trousers did not get wet."
ISEAR_7447	7447	"After seeing a horror film - Omen.  I could not sleep at night   
even though I closed my eyes.  The last scene of the film kept  
coming back to me, I seemed to hear the girls in the film  
shouting at the devil.  The devil did not have any expression on  
his face and I thought that he would choose me."
ISEAR_7448	7448	"My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that  
he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's  
house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I  
felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so  
he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is  
I was in a bad mood then)."
ISEAR_7449	7449	"I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good  
friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them  
I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind  
this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made  
up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was  
sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends."
ISEAR_7450	7450	"I had a friend who was very kind to me.  I tried my best to like  
him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help  
rejecting, criticizing and blaming him.  I wanted to get away  
from him as soon as possible."
ISEAR_7451	7451	"My teacher reminded us not to do a Summer job, however I did it  
for two months.  Yesterday I was chatting with my teacher and  
when we talked of the Summer job, I felt ashamed."
ISEAR_7452	7452	"I wanted to get rid of a bad habit and it seemed that I had  
succeeded.  However a year later I got the bad habit again.  I felt   
useless as I always found excuses to explain my behaviour.  As a result I  
felt guilty."
ISEAR_7453	7453	"During the exam period I studied in the library alone.  A close    
friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my  
application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had  
been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the  
list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was  
really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all  
day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the  
good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my  
studies.  
"
ISEAR_7454	7454	"A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes  
outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would  
question me on our relationship.  I treated him as a friend and  
did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet  
him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very  
unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble."
ISEAR_7455	7455	"We had fixed time for practice as we had to participate in the  
inter-department song contest.  I arrived and found that there  
was nobody there.  When I went to the canteen I found them eating  
lunch.  I was so angry that I aired my greviances to one of them  
and then left."
ISEAR_7456	7456	"A friend told me that he had suffered in love and in academics.   
I shared his sadness."
ISEAR_7457	7457	"A friend told me that a boy wanted to get to know me.  At that  
time I felt disgusted and thought that it was a nonsense thing."
ISEAR_7458	7458	"One rainy day when the streets were wet, and as I was walking down  
a slope, I fell down out of my carelessness.  There were many  
people and they saw me, so I felt ashamesd.  Moreover I hurt my  
ankle and it was painful."
ISEAR_7459	7459	"One night during dinner my nephew was naughty, so I quarrelled with my   
parents.   I regreted this as my nephew was only two years old and I   
had to tolerate him !  The quarrel made my father think that his children   
may not take care of him in the future (it was a slip of the tongue and   
this made me realize that my father keeps his thoughts to himself).  I was   
still very angry so I dropped my bowl and chopsticks and went to the kitchen   
to drink tea and then ran to the other side of the house."
ISEAR_7460	7460	"That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the  
higher level as fast as possible.  I opened the envelope very  
carefully and found that my results were much better than I  
had expected and thus I could enter the Chinese university.  My  
diligence had paid and I was very happy."
ISEAR_7461	7461	"When I was young I had gone to an old lift and played with the  
antique lift.  The guy discovered me and warned me, I was very  
frightened."
ISEAR_7462	7462	"Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very  
uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him  
furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence  
because of traditional moral values.  "
ISEAR_7463	7463	"My got my mathematics test's marks and could not believe that it  
was true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I  
getting weaker at studies ?  This made me feel that I should not  
expect too much from going to the university."
ISEAR_7464	7464	"My friend and I worked for the community centre by holding a booth.  
 One day my friend went off to another booth to play.  This  
meant that I was very busy and could not maintain order.  His  
behaviour disgusted me."
ISEAR_7465	7465	"When I was in a bus on my way to the examination centre, a man     
sitting opposite me kept looking at me continously.  I did not know   
what was wrong.  When I reached the  centre I started strolling around   
as I still had a little time.  Suddenly a man came and whispered ""You   
have forgotten to zip up your trousers.""  I was at a loss to say anything   
and I felt very embarrassed.  When I thought of the bus incident I felt   
even more ashamed."
ISEAR_7466	7466	"At secondary school, one of my classmates lost her locker key.   
During a class I saw two other classmates holding a key and  
talking secretly.  I do not know why I suspected them, also  
another classmate supported me.  He remembers that these people  
had only one key in the key-ring, this had seemed strange to him.  
 Besides another classmate said that he had seen them selling  
books at a book-shop and they should not have had such books.  I  
told the teacher and the person was caught.  He had sold the  
books and was forced to quit school.  I found that I had not  
helped him as he stole later on also.  I felt guilty"
ISEAR_7467	7467	"One night, my boyfriend expressed his love for me in the canteen in  
the presence of my friends by giving me a present."
ISEAR_7468	7468	"After listening to ghost stories with my classmates I had to back  
alone to the hostel at night.  I had to walk through a long and  
quiet road and I was scared of meeting a ghost."
ISEAR_7469	7469	"I came across a girl at the school bus-stop, I had seen her  
several friends as she was a friend's friend.  However my friend  
had never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus I  
smiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen  
me.  Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry."
ISEAR_7470	7470	"My examination results were not satisfactory even though I had  
tried my best.  Then I started wondering about my abilities for  
the major subject.  However I did not know how to choose my major  
subject if I were to change it."
ISEAR_7471	7471	"When my roommate and I had dinner together we decided as to who  
would clean the bowls.  One day when I came back from school I  
found that she had not cleaned up.  Since I had to cook dinner I  
cleaned them myself and felt unhappy and disgusted."
ISEAR_7472	7472	"When I asked my classmate to teach me to do my homework, he asked  
me to study by myself first but I did not do it.  When he asked me  
 if I had studied, I felt very ashamed. "
ISEAR_7473	7473	"I escaped from communicating with God for a long time.  I did not  
read the scriptures and I did not pray.  I felt that I was  
getting further and further away from God.  I felt guilty as this  
was because of my laziness."
ISEAR_7474	7474	"When two female classmates and I were having lunch, we chatted and   
cracked jokes, I was very happy.  However, I felt that I may have   
said something inappropriate which might cause them to have a bad   
impression of me."
ISEAR_7475	7475	"I did not do well in one of the subjects last term.   I was  
afraid that I would fail.  My result was a grade D, though it was  
not good I still passed.  I felt more comfortable then.  "
ISEAR_7476	7476	"My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt  
insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did  
not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other  
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant  
person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that  
nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not  
say anything but just watched me leave."
ISEAR_7477	7477	"Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before  
the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I  
got a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all       
good I felt a little sad."
ISEAR_7478	7478	"Whenever I spoke to a female classmate I felt disgusted.  She  
said meaningless things and seemed to indicate something to me  
but I did not love/like her."
ISEAR_7479	7479	"Once a female classmate told me that the clothes I wore seemed to  
be a child's clothes.  On hearing this I felt a little ashamed and  
I criticized her clothes though there was nothing wrong with  
them."
ISEAR_7480	7480	"Once while playing tennis with my classmate I lost a few tennis  
balls.  I found one near the tennis court and took it to be mine  
despite thinking that it might belong to the student in the next  
court.  I felt guilty.  Later someone came to me to claim the  
ball and I gave it back to him."
ISEAR_7481	7481	"When I received a letter from the university telling me that my  
application had been accepted."
ISEAR_7482	7482	"At primary school the teacher caught me cheating during a  
dictation."
ISEAR_7483	7483	Someone spread rumours about me.
ISEAR_7484	7484	"One night my father suddenly suffered from a heart attack which  
lead to breathing difficulties."
ISEAR_7485	7485	"The curriculum of the year !   The English course was very heavy.  
 I had not prepared and the teacher asked several questions  
during class.  The students were not ready to answer the  
questions and the teacher was frustated."
ISEAR_7486	7486	I forgot to zip up my trousers, this was not noticed by anyone.
ISEAR_7487	7487	Peeping.
ISEAR_7488	7488	I had a picnic with old classmates, we chatted and played games.
ISEAR_7489	7489	"At night when I was alone at home (all the family members usually  
get together at that time) someone knocked vigorously on the  
door."
ISEAR_7490	7490	"When I saw that my bed at the hostel was a mess I guessed that  
someone else had used my daily necessities.  I felt that my  personal  
sanity had been affected."
ISEAR_7491	7491	"During the Physics experiment session I did not understand the  
content of the experiment and did not know how to do it."
ISEAR_7492	7492	"A man sexually aggressed a small girl in the bus but the girl did  
not dare to speak out."
ISEAR_7493	7493	Being unable to stop urinating on the bus.
ISEAR_7494	7494	"There were old people in a crowded bus and I did not have the  
courage to give them my seat.  I closed my eyes to sleep and then  
opened my book to read.  In my heart I wanted to give them the  
seat."
ISEAR_7495	7495	"It was the first time that I gave a birthday present to my friend.  
  She wrote me a letter as she is my girlfriend.  The content of  
the letter was so sweet that it made me feel very happy. 
"
ISEAR_7496	7496	"It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I  
had tried and failed many times and this was the last time that  
I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld  
have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period  
- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice  
experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable  
fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright  
prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my  
brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue  
I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."
ISEAR_7497	7497	"The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often  
grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This  
made me angry."
ISEAR_7498	7498	"When I was in primary 6, my father died.  I was very young then  
and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives  
and my tears made me sad."
ISEAR_7499	7499	"At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid  
doing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch  
together and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had  
promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime  
after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize  
his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a  
university student and ought to have self-respect.  He  
disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him  
and did not want to keep any contact with him."
ISEAR_7500	7500	"My friend had many female friends and I thought that they were  
his lovers.  I would scold him but he did not accept my advice.   
Later I learnt from his girlfriends that this was not true.  I  
felt ashamed at having misunderstood him."
ISEAR_7501	7501	"In the past I used to think that my mother was a very nagging  
person.  When I started living at the hostel we had little time  
to meet each other.  Whenever I went home she would take care  
of me.  I gradually realized that what she had done was for my  
own good.  So very time I saw her I felt guilty."
ISEAR_7502	7502	"In August,1983, the long awaited ""big envelope"" (a document for  
C.U.H.K admission) arrived.  It was in the afternoon and I had  
not been doing anything.  When the postman, with his big bag,  
knocked on the door I knew what it was about.  I hurriedly  
opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe.  
 It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."
ISEAR_7503	7503	"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was  
afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very  
unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of  
passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to  
repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results  
were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a  
minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
ISEAR_7504	7504	"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not  
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation  
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt  
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost  
5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower  
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not  
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
ISEAR_7505	7505	"This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September  
I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in  
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not  
find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about  
sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.   
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock."
ISEAR_7506	7506	"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had  
melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played  
the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell  
him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right  
to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to  
leave the room and go somewhere else."
ISEAR_7507	7507	"Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was  
working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had  
joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female  
classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not  
fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I  
realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I  
said sorry to her and the matter came to an end."
ISEAR_7508	7508	I lied to one of my best friends.
ISEAR_7509	7509	I received a letter from a distant friend.
ISEAR_7510	7510	"My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a  
male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I  
hung up and heard someone walking outside our door."
ISEAR_7511	7511	"Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her  
grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in  
mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me  
and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.   
When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be  
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university   
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they  
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five  
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another  
child to teach."
ISEAR_7512	7512	"I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had  
prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After  
three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and  
failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others  
would think that I had not prepared for it."
ISEAR_7513	7513	"I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the  
door.  I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit  
and bring the germs in the house."
ISEAR_7514	7514	"I did not do the homework that the teacher had asked us to do.  I  
was scolded immediately."
ISEAR_7515	7515	"I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when  
I called out loudly."
